Revision history for Class-Tiny-ConstrainedAccessor

0.000014    2019-11-17 (TRIAL VERSION)
        - Also test with Type::Nano
        - Bump minimum Perl from 5.6 to 5.6.1 (for Types::TypeTiny)
        - Replace most custom constraint-building logic with
          a call to Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny().  This permits us to accept
          any type of constraint that function can accept. (#9)
          Thanks to TOBYINK for code used in the custom-constraint path.
